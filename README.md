# MathQuiz
Lesson 1: Classes, Variables, Properties, Methods

App Description: 

Create an app that asks the user to answer a basic math problem. Keep track of their score.

Concepts Learned: 

The difference between a class and an object, 
The difference between an int, string, and bool, 
The difference between properties and methods, 
How to use ViewControllers, 
How to use Storyboard to Incorporate UI into Your App, 
Difference Between .m and .h file, 
If Statements, 
The difference between the interface and implementation,

My Struggles:

I had a hard time understanding the difference between a method and property. Now, I understand that a method is kind of like a verb to an object where a property is like a noun to an object. For example, a polar bear may have the property "fur" where it has a method "eat". Methods use [ ]'s and a property uses dotnotation. It took me a while to grasp how the ViewController file in my folder interacts with the ViewController on the storyboard. I had to make sure I kept track of all the outles from my storyboard to prevent the app from crashing.
